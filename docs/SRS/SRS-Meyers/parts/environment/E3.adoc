=== (E.3) Constraints

TIP: _Obligations and limits imposed on the project and system by the environment. This chapter defines non-negotiable restrictions coming from the environment (business rules, physical laws, engineering decisions), which the development will have to take into account._  <<BM22>>

==== Constraints (non-negotiables from the environment)

Platform & OS:: Windows 10+ (x64) only for release. No macOS/Linux requirements.

Minimum hardware floor:: Must operate on the project’s **Minimum Spec** (see E.1 “Minimum Spec”). All targets/acceptance numbers live in S.6.

Input availability:: Keyboard + mouse must be fully usable. XInput-style gamepads are supported but not required for play.

Display baseline:: Game must be playable and UI text readable at 1280×720 (windowed or fullscreen).

Graphics API class:: Target a DX11-class GPU typical of the Minimum Spec era; no ray-tracing or VR-specific features are assumed.

File system & permissions:: Saves/settings/logs must live in a user-writable path. No administrator privileges required.

Time base:: All delays/latencies are measured in wall-clock seconds; the game must tolerate normal OS scheduling jitter.

Numeric sanity:: Environment values (fields, timers, counters) must be finite (no NaN/Inf) and within project-defined safe ranges.

World envelope:: Scene size, active objects, and editable terrain density must stay within bounds that keep playability on Minimum Spec (exact budgets verified in S.6).

I/O devices:: Support standard Windows audio output and the primary display device; no external sensors or network devices are required.

Determinism for tests:: For verification scenes only, a seeded run must be reproducible on the same machine; live gameplay is allowed to be non-deterministic.
