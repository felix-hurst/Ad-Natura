==== Terms (alphabetical)

Benchmark Scene:: A simple test level used to check performance and behavior consistently.
Cell:: The smallest terrain unit the game reasons about (a tile in the grid).
Field:: A number stored per cell that influences behavior (e.g., water, heat, light).
Frame:: One step of update/render in the game loop.
Heat Field:: A field where higher values mean “hotter” areas that the organism tends to avoid.
Input Device:: Keyboard + mouse or a standard Windows gamepad.
Latency:: Time between an environment change and when that change is made available to the system.
Light Field:: A field representing illumination intensity across the level.
Minimum Spec:: The lowest hardware/OS we support for stable play (see Problem Statement for the numbers).
Organism:: The slime-mould-like entity that moves through levels.
Publish (Environment):: Making updated fields/terrain available to the system after a change.
Stimulus:: A player/scripted action that changes fields or terrain (e.g., reveal water, add heat).
Terrain:: The destructible/editable level geometry made of cells.
Traversal:: How the organism moves through the level under the influence of fields and terrain.
Water Field:: A field where higher values mean more water availability that tends to attract the organism.
