TIP: _Clear and precise definitions of all the vocabulary specific to the application domain, including technical terms, words from ordinary language used in a special meaning, and acronyms. It introduces the terminology of the project; not just of the environment in the strict sense, but of all its parts._  <<BM22>>

==== Terms (alphabetical)

[[gl-bench]]Benchmark Scene:: A simple test level used to check performance and behavior consistently.
[[gl-cell]]Cell:: The smallest terrain unit the game reasons about (a tile in the grid).
[[gl-devscene]]Development Scene:: A flexible test scene used for debugging and iteration; not used for performance acceptance or timing. Distinct from <<gl-bench,Benchmark Scene>>.
[[gl-field]]Field:: A number stored per cell that influences behavior (e.g., water, heat, light).
[[gl-frame]]Frame:: One step of update/render in the game loop.
[[gl-heat]]Heat Field:: A field where higher values mean “hotter” areas that the organism tends to avoid.
[[gl-input]]Input Device:: Keyboard + mouse or a standard Windows gamepad.
[[gl-latency]]Latency:: Time between an environment change and when that change is made available to the system.
[[gl-light]]Light Field:: A field representing illumination intensity across the level.
[[gl-minspec]]Minimum Spec:: The lowest hardware/OS we support for stable play (see Problem Statement for the numbers).
[[gl-organism]]Organism:: The slime-mould-like entity that moves through levels.
[[gl-publish]]Publish (Environment):: Making updated fields/terrain available to the system after a change.
[[gl-playertrav]]Player Traversal:: How the player character moves and navigates levels (separate from <<gl-traversal,Organism Traversal>>).
[[gl-stimulus]]Stimulus:: A player/scripted action that changes fields or terrain (e.g., reveal water, add heat).
[[gl-terrain]]Terrain:: The destructible/editable level geometry made of cells.
[[gl-traversal]]Traversal:: How the organism moves through the level under the influence of fields and terrain.
[[gl-water]]Water Field:: A field where higher values mean more water availability that tends to attract the organism.
