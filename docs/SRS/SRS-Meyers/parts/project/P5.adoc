=== (P.5) Required technology elements

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _External systems, hardware and software, expected to be necessary for building the system. It lists external technology elements, such as program libraries and hardware devices, that the project is expected to require. Although the actual use of such products belongs to design and implementation rather than requirements, it is part of the requirements task to identify elements whose availability is critical to the success of the project â€” an important element of risk analysis (<<p6>>)._  <<BM22>>

The success of the project depends on the availability of the following external technologies and systems:

* *Unity 6.1:* The core game engine. Availability and continued support from Unity are critical. Any disruption to licensing, version stability, or major API changes would directly impact the project timeline.  

* *C# Language and Unity Libraries:* The scripting environment, including Unity' physics and rendering libraries, is essential for implementing game systems. If updates deprecate critical libraries, significant refactoring may be required.  

* *GitHub:* The project depends on GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration. Extended downtime or loss of access would risk development continuity.  

* *Hardware:*  
  - Development workstations capable of running Unity 6.1, Visual Studio, and testing builds efficiently (Our own computers).  
  - Target platforms (PC with sufficient specifications) for testing destructible environments, traversal, and player tools.  

* *Testing Frameworks:* External unity libraries and Unity Test Runner will be required for automated unit testing. Their availability ensures reliable verification of mechanics, performance, and stability.  

* *Asset Tools:* External tools such as digital art programs (e.g., Krita, Photoshop alternatives), audio editing software (e.g., Audacity), and 3D modeling tools may be required for assets. Availability of license-free resources is also important.
