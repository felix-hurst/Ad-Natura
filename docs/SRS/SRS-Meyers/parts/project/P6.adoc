**Obstacles and Mitigation Strategies by Sprint**

The overall critical risk is Scope Creep and uncontrolled technical debt, which could compromise the final delivery quality. The primary mitigation strategy is a rigorous adherence to the initial design scope and a strict policy of refactoring code before major new features are added.

**Sprint 0 (Foundation and Planning)**

* Obstacle: Technical Environment Setup takes longer than anticipated due to complexity of core mechanics.
**Prioritize Core Gameplay:** If specialized mechanics (e.g., advanced destruction physics) prove too time-consuming, reduce their scope to a "minimum viable feature" set to ensure the prototype is finished. Defer advanced elements to the Extras list in Sprint 3.

* Obstacle: Proof of Concept Demonstration fails to validate feasibility of key technical risks.
**Immediate Re-evaluation:** Implement a 1-2 week engineering halt to re-engineer the failed component or pivot the technical approach. This may require a reduction of feature scope to keep the overall schedule intact.

**Sprint 1 (Level Design and Demonstration)**

* Obstacle: Level Design Demonstration feedback is overwhelmingly negative, suggesting a major flaw in the design philosophy.
**Focused Redesign:** Dedicate the first half of Sprint 2 entirely to a major redesign of the level structure and mechanics based on feedback. Accept that this will compress the time available for the Integration task in Sprint 2.

**Sprint 2 (Integration and Documentation)**

* Obstacle: Integration reveals significant technical incompatibilities or performance issues between game systems.
**Systemic Debugging:** Enforce a strict code freeze on new features. Reallocate all resources to integration and bug-fixing. Simplify or temporarily remove any component deemed too unstable to preserve the overall build's playability.

* Obstacle: Design Document Revision 0 is delayed, leading to a lack of clarity for the final push.
**Decouple Documentation:** Prioritize the Integration and stability of the game build. Accept a delay on the documentation revision, aiming to finalize it early in Sprint 3, ensuring it still accurately reflects the final game state.

**Sprint 3 (Finalization and Delivery)**

* Obstacle: Bug Fixing effort reveals high-priority defects that are difficult to resolve late in the process.
**Critical Path Focus:** Categorize bugs by severity. Only fix absolute highest priority bugs that most affect functionality. Lower-priority bugs are to be documented as Known Issues in the final V&V Report to ensure the project meets the Final Demonstration deadline.
