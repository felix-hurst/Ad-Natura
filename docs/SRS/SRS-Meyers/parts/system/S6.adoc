==== Verification setup (baseline)

* Test scene: <<gl-bench,Benchmark Scene>> with scripted inputs.
* Hardware target: <<gl-minspec,Minimum Spec>> (lab box or equivalent VM).
* Timing: wall-clock; use monotonic timers for latency (see <<gl-latency,latency>>).
* Seeds: fixed <<gl-prng,PRNG>> seed for reproducible runs in CI (<<gl-ci,CI>>).
* Data sources: in-game counters/markers and lightweight logs; no debugger required.

| S6-PERF-1
| Playability on <<gl-minspec,Minimum Spec>>
| Run benchmark scene 5 minutes
| Avg <<gl-fps,FPS>>, 99th-pct frame time
| Avg ≥ 30 FPS; 99th-pct ≤ 60 ms

| S6-DET-1
| Seeded reproducibility in test scenes
| Run headless twice in CI with same seed
| Event/log hashes
| Identical outputs on same machine (see <<e-inv-seeded-tests>>)

| S6-COLL-1

| Carve/build then sample collision that frame
| Contact vs. cell state
| Match within same frame (see <<e-inv-collision-coherence>>)

| S6-FIN-1
| Finite/clamped environment values
| Sweep stimuli to extremes; log field samples
| NaN/Inf count; clamp range
| Zero NaN/Inf; all within configured bounds (see <<e-inv-finite>>, <<e-inv-bounds>>)

==== Gating & traceability

* A build **passes** S.6 only if all **Must** IDs above are met on <<gl-minspec,Minimum Spec>> in the <<gl-bench,benchmark scene>>.
* Failures on **Should** items are acceptable only if all **Must** remain green and the de-scope order in S.5 is followed.
* Relevant invariants and effects referenced: <<e-inv-publish-latency>>, <<e-inv-finite>>, <<e-inv-bounds>>, <<e-inv-atomic-edit>>, <<e-inv-collision-coherence>>, <<e-inv-seeded-tests>>, <<e5-reveal-water>>, <<e5-add-heat>>, <<e5-adjust-light>>.
